          Our team is committed to providing the best in everything we do,
          helping to ensure the only difference between a new and plug Certified
          Pre-Owned device is the price. From purchasing devices through Carrier
          Auctions and other certified dealers, to sanitizing and conducting
          hand tests with our 90+ point performance evaluation, every product we
          sell meets our incredibly high standards. And, unlike other retailers,
          each device is tested, cleaned, sanitized, graded, and shipped from
          plug’s headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri, helping to ensure the
          highest quality and performance.
